# Project Proposal

### Fit Check

### What and why?

Fit Check is a web-app that allows users to post their own outfit pictures and rate/comment on others's outfit pictures. It would be for people wanting to discuss or receive/give guidance on outfits in a constructive manner, as there are few active social platforms around fashion and outfits.

### For whom?

This app will be for people interested in discussing about fashion or looking to improve their outfits in a positive way.

### How?

After creating an account and profile, users would be allowed to post outfit pictures of themselves. Pictures will be posted with tags corresponding to styles or brands, allowing for easy filtering. Users are also able to rate and comment on pictures. They should be able to search pictures based on tags or keywords in text. 

Every user will also have their own personalized feed, from which they can choose which pictures they would want to rate or comment on. 

### Scope

This project is not too easy because many components will be needed. The frontend of user logins, profiles, feeds and searches will need to be designed. The backend and database would have to store user login and profile information and outfit posts. An algorithm would also have to be designed for user feeds and the searches.
